# Mobile Imgur

Mobile Imgur is an application targeted at the public imgur api, which I own nothing of. Obviously the code is open-source, take what you will.

The app
-------
This app is mainly meant to display how I code and how much code 30 hours - one week - actually represents.

###Features
  * Ability to change the different gallery search parameters;
  * GIF support;
  * Scalable gridview - goes from one column to 5;
  * Staggered gridview;
  * ViewPager where you can read the images description or the full albums;
  * Volume key scrolling - I personally love this type of scrolling and wish more applications had it;
  * A neat about page - featuring my face.
  

Note: The page should increase seamlessly.
